## Movement
First and foremost let’s go over the main movement options used in the speedrun. They are pretty straightforward but leave a lot of room to be optimized.

### Slash Jumping.
This is the most movement option you will be using most throughout the run. By slashing while on the ground with either Bilbo’s walking stick or his sword, then following it up with a jump, you get a forward momentum boost by maintaining the small lunge Bilbo has on his sword attack. Slash jumps can vary in distance quite a bit depending on the amount of time you wait to jump after performing a slash, so I recommend taking some time to get a good feel for this technique.

### Long Jumping.
Performed by pressing L followed by A when bilbo has the walking stick out, you perform a long jump in the direction you are holding the stick. This is very fast when done downhill, considerably faster than slash jumping. However, when you long jump and land on ground that is even with or above where you started, Bilbo will be stuck in a sliding animation upon landing. If there’s a place where you slide upon landing a long jump it is faster to perform a slash jump instead. 
Note, there’s something the community calls the “Long jump glitch” or LJG for short. This will stop your momentum mid long jump and make you fall almost straight down when it happens. We’ll get more into why this happens and how to avoid it later, but for now know that if your long jumps get cut short, it’s probably the long jump glitch. The long jump glitch is actually not present in the PAL GameCube version, however due to the lower framerate on that version (which has some strange side effects) I do not recommend it, but it is viable and can most likely be competitive with NTSC.

### Slash Boosting
This is a niche movement technique only really useful in various places, so it’s not too important to remember. If you perform a grounded slash right before you walk off a ledge, bilbo will be propelled forward quickly. This is also very susceptible to timing differences just like slash jumping, and a long jump is almost always just as fast and more consistent. There are very few places where a slash boost is preferred over a long jump, but when they are it is usually because in the given scenario you don’t want the extra height from long jumping.
